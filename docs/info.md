## How it works

This project is a hardware task scheduler for embedded systems. It monitors input pins and manages state transitions to execute specific tasks in sequence.

## How to test

To test this project, you can provide input signals via the `ui_in` pins and observe the changes on the `uo_out` pins. Use the provided Cocotb testbench to run automated simulations.

## External hardware

List any external hardware needed here, such as LEDs, buttons, or a specific microcontroller.
